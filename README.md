> _Part of [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.tech): powerful tools for building, testing & debugging HTTP(S)_

A tiny demo app using SSL pinning to block HTTPS MitM interception.

## Try it out

You can either clone this repo and build it yourself in Android Studio..

Pressing each button will send an HTTP request with the corresponding configuration. The buttons are purple initially or while a request is in flight, and then turn green or red (with corresponding icons, and an error message popped up for failures) when the request succeeds/fails.

On a normal uninterested device, every button should always immediately go green. On a device whose HTTPS is being intercepted (e.g. by [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.tech/android)) all except the first button will go red, unless you've used Frida or similar to disable certificate pinning.
